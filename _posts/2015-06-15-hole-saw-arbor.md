description: Making a heavy duty hole saw arbor for more precise drilling in iron and steel.
---

Standard hole saw arbors generally are pretty flemsy. They don't hold the saw
securely, so when it first hits the surface it tends to wander around and score
up the material sounding the hold. Also when doing any kind of heavy duty drilling
the little pins that drive the saw tend to shear off. I have a job coming up
where I will need to drill reasonably neat holes in cast iron with a hole saw,
so I made up this "Heavy Duty" arbor.
