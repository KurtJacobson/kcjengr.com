While the chucks that came with the G0602 were quite decent, the chuck keys were
very roughly finished and did not fit well in the recesses. Also the shafts were
short and the handles long, so it was impossible to spin the key around - had to
remove it and re-insert every 90&deg; which is a _pain_. So the first job for
the lathe was to make some new keys. What a huge improvement!
