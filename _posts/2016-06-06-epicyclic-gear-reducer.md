I am taking Rapid Design and Manufacture (MET3332) this summer.  For the second
assignment we had to design some device that had multiple moving components,
could be printed without requiring any assembly or finishing, and used a maximum
of 1in^3 of material. I decided to print something with gears to test their
functionality, so I designed this little spiral bevel gear speed trippler.
