I designed this little epicyclic gear reducer as a project for a Rapid Design
and Manufacture (MET3332) class I am taking this summer. We were asked to design
an interesting mechanical device that did not require assembly, and took advantage
of the unique capabilities of additively manufactured parts. We were also
challenged to keep the material volume below 1in<sup>3</sup>.

Inspiration came from drawings of old mill equipment, which used this type of
arrangement to provide a faster rotating shaft within a slower hollow shaft. It seems
like a planetary gear box would be more practical, but it may be that at the time
bevel gears were easier to make.

The spiral bevel gears were generated using GearTrax for Solidworks. All
clearances are .020in which should be enough to allow the printer to generate
adequate support material to keep the parts from fusing together. The spiral
gears result in a very smooth and quiet operation.
