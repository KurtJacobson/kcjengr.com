My name is Kurt Jacobson. I am a Mechanical Engineer and a Certified
Manufacturing Technologist (CMfgT). My main areas of interest are Controls and
Industrial Automation. My hobbies include metalworking, woodworking, programing,
and restoration of American and British vintage autos. I also enjoy hiking,
especially at high altitude.
